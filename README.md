# Travel-Weather-Forecast Description
For this challenge we were tasked with creating a weather dashboard with the following user story:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
(will be revisiting functions below couldnt get it to work)
WHEN I click on a city in the search history 
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
